OWASP SocialOSINTLM, is a Python-based OSINT project designed to streamline the process of gathering and analysing social media activity for intelligence purposes. The tool automates the collection of data from multiple popular platforms, including Twitter/X, Reddit, Hacker News, and Bluesky, providing a unified view of a target user's online presence. It uses the OpenRouter API to analyse both text and media content, providing insights into user behaviour, interests, communication styles, and potential affiliations etc. The tool offers both interactive and programmatic modes, a robust caching system, extensive error handling, and detailed logging. And only uses official platform API rather than web scraping.

### Road Map
The project is virtually complete with only potentially minor QOL remaining. Potentially migrate some settings to .env or build a GUI.
